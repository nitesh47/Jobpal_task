# Jobpal_task

The JSON dataset consists of two features set and a target set corresponding to the feature set.
The feature sets are title, description and target set is the Level. 
The task was to find the missing levels from the target set. 

I addressed this task as a multiclass classification problem.
The text corpus includes 4 classes where all the classes are unbalanced. Due to insufficient data, the upsampling or downsampling excluded.
